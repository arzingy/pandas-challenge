## Observable Trends
- As can be seen in [Math Scores By Grade](#math-scores-by-grade) and [Reading Scores By Grade](#reading-scores-by-grade), the average scores both in Math and Reading do not
depend on students grade. It does depend on the school, because students from different grades but from the same school have similar average scores.
- As can be seen in [Scores By School Spending](#scores-by-school-spending), the less school spends on student, the better their scores will be both in Math and Reading and the greater will their Overall, Math and Reading % Passing be.
- As can be seen in [Scores By School Size](#scores-by-school-size), small (<1000) and medium (1000-2000) schools show similar results in scores and % passing, however, large (2000-5000) schools
tend to show lower scores and % passing.
- As can be seen in [Scores By School Type](#scores-by-school-type), charter schools show significantly better results in scores and % passing than district schools.
